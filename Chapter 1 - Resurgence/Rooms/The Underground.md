The players begin here, and are tasked with escaping from this point. There is a chance for several encounters and exploration before heading to the Ground Floor, either via the stairs to the Guards Quarter or the Butchery

#### Starting Cell

The party starts in here, the interior of the cell contains a bucket to poop in and two bedrolls, other then that the cell is sparse, cramped and damp.

There are two exits:
1. A small crevasse that cannot be traversed in its current state but could potentially be broken with a high enough strength roll. 
2. The cell door that is locked, the key is on one of the guards stationed nearby

Assuming none of the players finds a way out the guards will notice the party has awoken and start the process of trying to get them up to the slaughter room to be killed and stripped of their bones. This will allow them to exit the cells and potentially make moves to begin the escape process

#### Other Cell

This cell has bloodstains that dot it, the cell door leading in is unlocked an opened.

On an investigation check of 14 the players will notice torn bits of hide clothing similar to their own and drag marks leading out of the cell that indicate a struggle.

#### Center Cave

At the center of the cave the guards are keeping watch over the cells

#### Stairway to Ground Floor

#### Aquifer

#### Bloody Landfill
