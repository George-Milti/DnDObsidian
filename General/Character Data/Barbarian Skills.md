# Abilities

## Rage

In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. On your [turn](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Combat#toc_5), you can enter a rage as a [bonus action](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Combat#toc_6).  
  
While raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren't wearing [heavy armor](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Armor#toc_3):  
  
• You have [advantage](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Ability%20Scores#toc_2) on [Strength checks](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Ability%20Scores#toc_13) and [Strength](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Ability%20Scores#toc_12) [saving throws](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Ability%20Scores#toc_35).  
  
• When you make a [melee weapon attack](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Combat#toc_39) using Strength, you gain a +2 bonus to the [damage roll](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Combat#toc_48). This bonus increases as you level.  
  
• You have [resistance](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Combat#toc_51) to [bludgeoning](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Combat#toc_50), [piercing](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Combat#toc_50), and [slashing](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Combat#toc_50) damage.  
  
If you are able to [cast](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Spells#toc_10) [spells](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Spells#toc_2), you can't cast them or [concentrate](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Spells#toc_22) on them while raging.  
  
Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked [unconscious](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Conditions#toc_14) or if your turn ends and you haven't [attacked](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Combat#toc_21) a hostile creature since your last turn or taken [damage](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Combat#toc_46) since then. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action.  
  
Once you have raged the maximum number of times for your barbarian level, you must finish a [long rest](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Resting#toc_2) before you can rage again. You may rage 2 times at 1st level, 3 at 3rd, 4 at 6th, 5 at 12th, and 6 at 17th.

# Special

## Reckless Attack

Starting at 2nd level, you can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with fierce desperation. When you make your first [attack](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Combat#toc_21) on your [turn](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Combat#toc_5), you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you [advantage](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Ability%20Scores#toc_2) on [melee weapon attack](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Combat#toc_39) rolls using [Strength](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Ability%20Scores#toc_12) during this turn, but [attack rolls](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Combat#toc_32) against you have advantage until your next turn.

# Passives

## Unarmored Defense

While you are not wearing any [armor](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Armor#content), your Armor Class equals 10 + your [Dexterity](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Ability%20Scores#toc_17) [modifier](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Ability%20Scores#toc_1) + your [Constitution](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Ability%20Scores#toc_23) modifier. You can use a [shield](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Shield#content) and still gain this benefit.

## Danger Sense

At 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren't as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger. You have [advantage](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Ability%20Scores#toc_2) on [Dexterity](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Ability%20Scores#toc_17) [saving throws](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Ability%20Scores#toc_35) against effects that you can see, such as [traps](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Traps#content) and [spells](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Spells#toc_2). To gain this benefit, you can't be [blinded](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Conditions#toc_1), [deafened](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Conditions#toc_3), or [incapacitated](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Conditions#toc_6).

## Primal Knowledge

You gain proficiency in another skill of your choice from the skill list available to Barbarians at level 1.

In addition, while your Rage is active, you can channel primal power when you attempt certain tasks; whenever you make an ability check using one of the following skills, you can make it as a Strength check even if it normally uses a different ability: [Acrobatics](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills), [Intimidation](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills), [Perception](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills), [Stealth](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills), or [Survival](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills). When you use this ability, your Strength represents primal power coursing through you, honing your agility, bearing, and senses.
