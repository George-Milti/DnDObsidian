# Cantrips

## Primal Savagery

_Transmutation cantrip_

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** S  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You channel primal magic to cause your teeth or fingernails to sharpen, ready to deliver a corrosive attack. Make a melee spell attack against one creature within 5 feet of you. On a hit, the target takes 1d10 acid damage. After you make the attack, your teeth or fingernails return to normal.

**_At Higher Levels._** The spell’s damage increases by 1d10 when you reach 5th level (2d10), 11th level (3d10), and 17th level (4d10).

## Magic Stone

_Transmutation cantrip_

**Casting Time:** 1 bonus action  
**Range:** Touch  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** 1 minute

You touch one to three pebbles and imbue them with magic. You or someone else can make a ranged spell attack with one of the pebbles by throwing it or hurling it with a sling. If thrown, it has a range of 60 feet. If someone else attacks with the pebble, that attacker adds your spellcasting ability modifier, not the attacker’s, to the attack roll. On a hit, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your spellcasting ability modifier. Hit or miss, the spell then ends on the stone.

If you cast this spell again, the spell ends early on any pebbles still affected by it.

# Level 1 Spells

## Earth Tremor

_1st-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Self (10-foot radius)  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You cause a tremor in the ground in a 10-foot radius. Each creature other than you in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. If the ground in that area is loose earth or stone, it becomes difficult terrain until cleared.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.
