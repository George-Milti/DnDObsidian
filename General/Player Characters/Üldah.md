Üldah's role in the tribe is a ritualistic one with her creation of totems to ward off evil spirits. A tedious job as the raw materials needed are to be harvested from both the calm dirt and the ferocious animals that roam it. Her role has given her great confidence in more hands on tasks.

However this confidence can be a double edged sword as Üldah's confidence sometimes extends beyond what she is capable of in the moment, even if she is capable in the long run of learning and understanding something she will often charge forth headstrong into her problems with that blind confidence and cause a mess of the situation.

While she might lack humility in her failures and often search for excuses, she is still very strong and capable.

She enjoys watching the sunrise.
