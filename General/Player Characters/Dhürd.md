Profile : 
Dhürd is attuned to the elements of the earth, a great blessing in the tribes that form [[Clan Mhärk]]. They serve a role not dissimilar to a shaman, or priest. Many tribes people confide in Dhürd and they are more then willing to impart their wisdom upon them. 

They view their gift as a tool to enact the balance of nature they reside in, even if this means harm upon other beings even if those beings reside in the clan - Violence is always an option.

Dhürd enjoys tea, an oddity amongst his tribe who are primarily beer drinkers.
