Profile : 
Krähn is a true nomad at heart even amongst the nomadic tribes of [[Clan Mhärk]]. He has ventured far from the [[Iron Peaks]] to distant lands but inevitably is always drawn back. 

Having traveled around he has seen the various characters that exist in different parts of the world which has made him more warry of strangers. The experiences of friendship and betrayal in distant lands has made his mind and body a fortress, even if that comes across as distant and cold to people who interact with him.

Krähn is a more introverted person, who values his alone time but understands the strength of working as team.

His favourite food is pear.
