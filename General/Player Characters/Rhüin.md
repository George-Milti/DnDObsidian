Rh√ºin is not the sharpest tool in the shed, but hes good with sharp weapons.
A boisterous attitude clads this mighty warrior in armor. His body is trained and his senses are keen. Just don't ask him to read.

Rhuin loves talking but the topics are usually rather simple, its more he doesn't like the silence then trying to have a good conversation.

He has an unending loyalty to his battle-brothers

He likes squirrels and rabbits.
